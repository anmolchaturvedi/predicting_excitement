## Donors Choose: Predicting Donor Excitement for Classroom Projects

I performed analysis and modeling utilizing Python pandas and scik-itlearn on [Donors Choose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) data to predict full funding of listed projects.


### Files Included
My analysis, model creation, and analysis can be found in [`donors_choose.ipynb`](https://github.com/lorenh516/predicting_excitement/blob/master/donors_choose.ipynb).

The repository also contains files for helper functions for data exploration ([`ml_explore.py`](https://github.com/lorenh516/predicting_excitement/blob/master/ml_explore.py)), preprocessing (`[ml_pipeline_lch.py`](https://github.com/lorenh516/predicting_excitement/blob/master/ml_pipeline_lch.py)), and model creation and evalution 
([`magiclooping.py`](https://github.com/lorenh516/predicting_excitement/blob/master/magiclooping.py) and [`ml_modeling.py`](https://github.com/lorenh516/predicting_excitement/blob/master/ml_modeling.py)).
